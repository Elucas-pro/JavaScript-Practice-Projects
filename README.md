This repository contains JS projects i create while learning. Each one explores new concepts for me at the time of making them.

So far, the JS code is always inside the HTML file.

- Simple Calculator : A simple calculator, my first project. Also my first use of a JS library.

- Cart Quantity : Tracks the quantity of items on a cart, to a maximum of ten items. Helped me learn functions and if statements.

- Rock Paper Scissors : Code for the game Rock Paper Scissors.
