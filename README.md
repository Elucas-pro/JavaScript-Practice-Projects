This repository contains small JS projects i create while learning. Each one explores new concepts for me at the time of making them.

- Simple Calculator : A simple calculator, my first project. Uses Eval for now.

- Cart Quantity : Tracks the quantity of items on a cart, to a maximum of ten items. Helped me learn functions and simple if statements.

- Rock Paper Scissors : Simple code for the game Rock Paper Scissors.
